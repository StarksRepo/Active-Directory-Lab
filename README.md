## Windows Server 2019 
1. Set Static IP Address
 * Using a static IP address is best for documentation and management (ex. firewall rules). Static IP addresses allows the server to have its own set IP address rather than depending on the DHCP server to provide us one. This will lessen the possibility of a server outage due to a failing DHCP server.
 * Server IP set to 172.16.0.1
